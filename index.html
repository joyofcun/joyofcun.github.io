      <h3>
          Welcome to Haukai Restaurant
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        With our mission of "Delivering Wow, Sharing Happiness," we have been striving every day to provide the best dining experience to all of our dear guests. 
        A restaurant should not be a place to simply have a meal. We truly want every guest to leave happy with our food, service, and environment that delivers the "Wow" factor. 
        We continue to evolve and improve every day so that we can always fulfill our mission of "Delivering Wow, Sharing Happiness" to every guest.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Quiet, efficient and attentive. That's what you get with Haukai Restaurant and our two very lovely managers. 
        Paired with a modish wine list and chef's deceptively simple food, we're a force indeed.</p> 
      <br>
      <p>Find us in:  3 Cleary Street, Waterloo, Lower Hutt 5011, New Zealand </p>
